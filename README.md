## Quick Info

**Entropy**, in general, is a task manager built into the terminal with various features such as:

- **Terminating** processes
- **Viewing table of all of processes**
- **Finding** processes by name or ID
- **Suspending/Unsuspending** processes

As a developer I have some plans for such features as:

- **Real-time** display of CPU, RAM, GPU usage (possibly even with a graph).
- **Capability** to sort processes by CPU, RAN or GPU usage
- **Versatility** - so that anyone who knows C# can easily make changes in the code and create their own modifications for entropy
- **and much more!**
   
And with future versions and tons of my free time, there will be even more :)
