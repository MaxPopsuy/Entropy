## Quick Info

**Entropy**, in general, is a task manager built into the terminal with various features such as:

- **Terminating** processes
- **Viewing table of all of processes**
- **Finding** processes by name or ID
- **Suspending/Unsuspending** processes

As a developer I have some plans for such features as:

- **Real-time** display of CPU, RAM, GPU usage (possibly even with a graph).
- **Capability** to sort processes by CPU, RAM or GPU usage
- **Versatility** - so that anyone who knows C# can easily make changes in the code and create their own modifications for entropy
- **and much more!**
   
And with future versions and tons of my free time, there will be even more :)

- finally make process list as a table
- advanced find (?)
- more advanced help command
- better terminal ui
- better version handling
- refactoring

v1.2.0:

- add ram/cpu/gpu usage to list of processes
- more functions
- advanced status function (i.e. sort by name/ram usage etc.)
- more suspend/unsuspend functionality
- refactoring

v1.3.0:

- add charts of ram/cpu/gpu usage
- add autostart commands
- more commands and functions (?)
- settings command
- show detailed stats of your processes usage of ram/cpu/gpu
- refactoring

v1.4.0:

- themes
- theme loader

v2.0.0:

- custom loader for user mods (?)
- - so i think in theory, i can make some code to kinda "load" other files(e.g. "mods") into some point in code, but i think I'll only do this for custom themes, which you can change right in terminal itself
- net scanner (?)
- final refactioring
