> Entropy provides powerful capabilities for managing system processes. Improper use, especially with critical system processes, can lead to unintended consequences such as system instability or data loss. Always ensure you understand the impact of the commands you execute and use this tool responsibly.

- **Terminate Processes**: End processes with a simple command.
- **View Process Table**: Display a comprehensive list of all running processes.
- **Find Processes**: Search for processes by name or ID.
- **Suspend/Unsuspend Processes**: Temporarily halt or resume process execution.

### Planned Features

- **Real-Time System Monitoring**: Display CPU, RAM, and GPU usage in real-time, potentially with graphical representations.
- **Advanced Sorting**: Sort processes by CPU, RAM, or GPU usage.
- **Extensibility**: Allow C# developers to modify and extend Entropyâ€™s functionality.
- **And More**: Continuous improvements and additional features in future releases.
